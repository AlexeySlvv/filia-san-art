Ramsay planned the portrait as a gift to his close personal friend and fellow Scot, David Hume. Hume, who was himself an internationally eminent Enlightenment philosopher and historian, had facilitated Rousseau's escape from France to Britain in 1766. He also found him somewhere to stay and secured a pension for him from King George III. Ramsay painted a portrait of Hume as a companion to this picture, to hang in Hume's own home (also NGS [Scottish National Portrait Gallery]). Sadly, the friendship which helped to generate this sensitive portrait very quickly soured.
