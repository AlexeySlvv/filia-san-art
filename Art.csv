Rousseau's unusual clothing aroused great curiosity on his arrival in London and this picture gives a very good idea of the fascination it provoked. Ramsay planned the portrait as a gift to his close personal friend and fellow Scot, David Hume. Hume, who was himself an internationally eminent Enlightenment philosopher and historian, had facilitated Rousseau's escape from France to Britain in 1766. He also found him somewhere to stay and secured a pension for him from King George III. Ramsay painted a portrait of Hume as a companion to this picture, to hang in Hume's own home (also NGS [Scottish National Portrait Gallery]). Sadly, the friendship which helped to generate this sensitive portrait very quickly soured.

With his long cane the conjuror summons up an abundance of Old Master prints, while in his hand is a print of Raphael's 'Diadem Madonna'. The subject, 'Truth is revealed to Man', is a pointed reference to Reynold's artistic practice. After a brief showing at the Academy, it was requested that the painting be removed. Hone was furious, and promptly withdrew from the Royal Academy.
